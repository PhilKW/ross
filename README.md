The ROSS projects goal is to provide a collection of ros and ros2 nodes for satellites and rover subsystems.

This repository will contains the core files for a suit of programs based on ROS1.0 and ROS2.0 for space applications and autonomous planetary rover mission scenarios.

The project consists of two core workspaces one for ROS1.0 and one for ROS2.0.
These can be extended by system specific software repositories. The core applications are designed to widely applicable in space mission scenarios, indeptently from the designated platform.
